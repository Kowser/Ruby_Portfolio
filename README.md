Ruby Portfolio
====================
######The following is my work in Ruby, not to be confused with Ruby on Rails
######Each program was written to pass the written TDD tests.

These projects were designed to teach a TDD approach, followed by breaking down each problem into manageable code pieces and resolving them one by one until a fully functional piece of software glistened.
